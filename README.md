# Brain-Trainer
The Brain Trainer Game uses math to train various parts of the
brain when it comes to fast thinking. Using intents and a simple
switch the user can change the difficulty of the game (From simple
addition of numbers to multiplication). Furthermore, using shared
preferences, the app remembers which choice the user has made
regarding the difficulty.
