# Brain-Trainer
The Java Android app is designed to help the user train their brain using math. The app has two difficulty levels, addition and multiplication, which the user can select from the settings page using a switch. The app stores the user's preferred difficulty level on the local device using SharedPreferences. The app presents random math problems to the user, and they have to solve them within a limited time frame. If the user answers the questions correctly, they receive points, and the app keeps track of their score.
When the game is about to end, the app makes a ticking noise to indicate that the game is almost over. The app also uses the Random class to present different answer choices to the user. The user can select an answer by clicking on the corresponding button.

What I learned during development:

- The first thing I learned was how to use SharedPreferences to store user preferences locally on the device. This allowed me to save the user's preferred difficulty level so that they wouldn't have to set it every time they used the app.
- The second thing I learned was how to use the Random class to generate random numbers for the math problems presented to the user. This allowed the app to present different problems to the user each time they played, keeping the game interesting and challenging.
