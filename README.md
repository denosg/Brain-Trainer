# Brain-Trainer
The Brain Trainer Game uses math to train various parts of the
brain when it comes to fast thinking. Using intents and a simple
switch the user can change the difficulty of the game (From simple
addition of numbers to multiplication). Furthermore, using shared
preferences, the app remembers which choice the user has made
regarding the difficulty.

This is one of my first apps. What i learned during development:
- how to use SharedPreferences class to store the preffered difficulty in the game
- how to use the MediaPlayer class to play sounds during the end game
- how to set a timer that plays a ticktock sound that starts when there are <5 seconds remaining in the game
- how to implement different answers using the Random class
